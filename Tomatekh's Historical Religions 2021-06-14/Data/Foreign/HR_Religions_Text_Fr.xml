			<Text>Zulu indigenous belief is primarily one of ancestor worship. The spirits of the dead are understood to be responsible for the living and to care for the community's wealth and cattle. Particular veneration is shown towards the "amatongo"; the honored ancestors of an individual or clan. The amatongo are in charge of bringing correction and balance to the community and are understood to be as present in the homestead as its living members. The paramount act of honoring and communing with the ancestors is accomplished through the ritual sacrifice of cattle, which continues to hold significance in traditional Zulu culture today. </Text>

			<Text>Two key figures in the Zulu mythic cycle are "Unkulunkulu" (First Man) and the Lord-of-the-Sky. In the period before human understanding, Unkulunkulu is believed to have emerged from a bed of reeds. The knowledge of everything was brought forth through the power of Unkulunkulu's speech; "nommo". Yet, Unkulunkulu is not understood as a supreme being. No one worships or prays to Unkulunkulu because he is so far away. Over time, a direct connection between humankind and Unkulunkulu has been lost. Instead, Unkulunkulu is seen to be as natural as rain, or food, or cattle.</Text>

			<Text>Similarly, the Lord-of-the-Sky emerged from the reeds after Unkulunkulu. It is also from the Lord-of-the-Sky that the Zulu get their name. However, the Lord-of-the-Sky is not regarded as a distant ruler to be revered and worshipped. There is also no cosmological relationship between the Lord-of-the-Sky and Unkulunkulu. In the traditional sense, the Lord-of-the-Sky cannot be understood as an indigenous denomination of an almighty god. Such interpretations came about only later after the introduction of Christian concepts into the Zulu mythos. Consequently, modern Zulu religious practice often focuses on the Lord-of-the-Sky as a more traditional western God figure and prayer and sacrifice are often directed to him rather than the venerated ancestors.</Text>

			<Text>The harshness and unpredictability of life in the Arctic ensured a preoccupation with the uncontrollable; a streak of bad luck could destroy an entire community. To offend a spirit was to risk its interference with an already marginal existence. The Inuit understood that they had to work in harmony with supernatural powers to provide the necessities of day-to-day life. Traditional Inuit religion was thus closely integrated into the daily life of the people. Rituals were simple but held to be necessary and hunting was understood in a ritual context. By believing that all things, including animals, had souls like those of humans, any hunt that failed to show appropriate respect and customary supplication would only give the liberated spirits cause to avenge themselves.</Text>

Although Indra as storm god is a functional cognate and holds a similar position of prominence compared to other Indo-European religions, the name Indra itself is not a linguistic cognate and may be related to the Indus Valley language.

Since a great number of the figurines lack specific attributes, they could easily be accommodated to the needs of the moment, perhaps for rites connected to fertility, agriculture, or various other magical procedures relating to the problems of everyday life.</Text>

Donkeys, sheep, and goats were highly prized as sacrificial animals. Although human sacrifice was practiced, Canaanite tradition also promoted strong familial veneration for both the living and the dead. Bodies were buried with grave goods and offerings of food and drink were made to the dead to ask for guidance and ensure they would not trouble the living.

The world was understood to be the speech of the gods written down; directly visible in the stars of the sky. The sublunary realm of man was considered to be a reflection of this divine script. Because of this, the whole of nature - the transformed body of Tiamat - assumed a divinatory value and could be read as a type of code to discern the will of the gods. This structure of ontology and cosmology is based on the notion that since divine speech gave birth to everything, man can accomplish a return to the source through theurgic speech; the utterance of Marduk's divine name. Astrology, reading the divine script of the stars, is part of this design since the speech of the gods was understood to be fixed for eternity.</Text>

On the political stage, Assyria seemed to be in constant struggle with neighboring Babylon for control of the region. When the Assyrian king Sennacherib finally destroyed Babylon in 689 BC, a deliberate attempt can be seen in the historical record to transfer the primeval achievements of Marduk, patron of Babylon, to Ashur.

			<Text>Restorationism, also known as Christian Primitivism, refers to a large group of independent Christian denominations that share the common belief that Christianity should be restored to the condition of the early apostolic church, which Restorationists see as the search for a more pure and ancient form of the religion. Restorationism is in contrast to Successionism, typified by Baptist Christianity, which attempts the continuation of the pure church through the centuries. Many Restorationist churches developed from the Second Great Awakening; a Protestant religious revival movement during the early nineteenth century in the United States characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the supernatural.</Text>

			<Text>Although arising from a similar desire to restore Christianity, almost all Restorationist churches are ideologically and politically independent from each other. Thus, Restorationism is best understood as a movement within Christianity rather than a descriptor for a specific branch or denomination. However, they all share a basic desire to return to the practice of the original, essential, and universal features of the Christian religion. Different groups have tried to implement this vision in different ways. Some have focused on the structure and practice of the church, others on living an ethical life, and others on direct experience with the Holy Spirit. The relative importance given to the Restorationist ideal, and the extent to which the full restoration of the early church is believed to have been achieved, also varies between groups.</Text>

Arius's basic premise was the uniqueness of God, who alone is self-existent and immutable. Because the Godhead is unique and immutable, the Son must be considered a finite being who has been called into existence out of nothing and has had a beginning. According to its opponents, especially the bishop Athanasius, Arius's teaching reduced the Son to a demigod, reintroduced polytheism (as worship of the Son was not abandoned), and undermined the Christian concept of redemption since only he who was truly God could have reconciled man to the Godhead.</Text>

The Cathari also viewed much of the Old and New Testaments with reserve. Cathar doctrines of creation led them to rewrite the biblical story and they devised an elaborate mythology to replace it.

They are primarily characterized by the secrecy associated with their initiation and cultic practice. Because of this, and persecution by Christians in Late Antiquity, it is difficult to form a complete picture of the various religious schools. Regardless, many mysteries were a product of orientalism in the ancient world, incorporating religious practices from surrounding cultures such as Egypt and Babylon, as well as surviving pre-Greek and Roman cultural traditions, such as on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily.

The mysteries reenacted the myth of the abduction of Persephone from her mother, Demeter, by the king of the underworld, in a cycle with three phases which celebrated the ascent of Persephone and her reunion with her mother.

Drawing from traditional religious practice, mystery cults, orientalism, and the philosophical tradition, Neoplatonism (especially as formulated by Iamblichus c.

			<Text>Although modern culture tends to popularize Greek philosophy as the epitome of rational discourse (due to an overemphasis placed on the philosophy of Aristotle and his Peripatetic school), Greek philosophy primarily took the form of an integrated combination of knowledge and practice. For many schools, the goal of this philosophical way of life was a form of self-deification; "episteme" (knowledge) made one a "theios aner" (divine man). Neoplatonism championed the deification of the soul through the ineffable eros of and union with the One. The method to achieve this union varied. Although the earlier school of Plotinus is sometimes argued to have been purely rational, even he proposed visualization exercises structurally and functionally identical to the theurgic rituals championed by Iamblichus.</Text>

Modern Pueblo beliefs depict a North Road leading to "Shipapu" (Place of Origin) and along which the spirits of the dead travel. North America experienced significant climatic change around AD 1150 in the form of a 300 year drought. Evidence suggests a profound change in religion during this period. Religious structures constructed along astronomical alignments were systematically dismantled. Pueblo tradition holds that the ancestors had achieved great spiritual power and control over natural forces and used their power in ways that caused nature to change. However, these changes were never meant to occur. It is possible that the Pueblo dismantling their religious structures was an effort to symbolically undo the changes they believed they caused and to make amends with nature.</Text>

Others, such as the Domba, are used for social bonding within the community. Although dancing under the full moon is used in many rituals of worship, particularly to Tsui-goab and Cagn, the Khoisan themselves do not specifically worship the moon. Through dancing, the Khoisan people believe they can cross the bridge between the living and the dead to banish evil deities responsible for causing illness.</Text>

However, it is likely that the form of Catholicism practiced in the Kingdom of Kongo maintained a large amount of traditional belief. Bakongo religion was naturally syncretic and many of its preexisting belief structures bore superficial similarities to those introduced by Christian missionaries. As such, the Bakongo people saw various elements of Christian ritual as a natural extension of their traditional belief, while Christian missionaries readily used preexisting Kikongo terms to facilitate conversion.</Text>

Cultic worshiped focused on Aten, a relatively obscure sun god. He was primarily a minor aspect of the greater god Re, depicted as the sun disk during the Middle Kingdom. Although solar cults had always held a preeminent place in Egyptian belief, Akhenaton raised the supremacy of Aten with the startling innovation that Aten was to be the only god. Although each line of kings prior to the reign of Akhenaten had previously adopted one deity as the royal patron and supreme state god, there had never been an attempt to exclude other deities, and the multitude of gods had been tolerated and worshipped at all times.

One particularly notable aspect of many Pacific Northwest belief systems, especially among the Haida, is reincarnation.

Finally, the lowest level was the Beneath World. It was thought to be a cold, dark place of chaos that was home to the Great Serpent and Corn Mother. These three worlds were connected by an axis mundi, usually portrayed as a cedar tree or striped pole. Deeply ingrained in this world view was the concept of duality and opposition.

			<Text>The defining idea of the Ājīvika movement was its doctrine of absolute determinism. All life is guided by 'niyati' (fate), free will does not exist, and everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Because of this, Ājīvika rejected the notion of karma central to many of its contemporary religions. The philosophy also included a theory of atoms where all matter is composed of aggregates of primordial material predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were mostly considered non-theistic, but, similar to Hinduism and Jainism, believed in the existence of 'ātman' (self-essence or soul) within every living being.</Text>

			<Text>The Elamite pantheon is difficult to fully reconstruct. It consisted of a number of deities from Elam's principal geopolitical entities; many of which functionally overlapped or waned in importance throughout Elam's history. As Susa remained in the Mesopotamian orbit for extended periods, several Sumerian and Akkadian deities also enjoyed a degree of popular acceptance. However, three gods can be understood as playing a central role in developed Elamite religion: Khumban, his wife Pinikir (eventually conflated with the goddess Kiririsha in the south), and Insusinak. Insusinak was originally the patron god of Susa and his rise to the role of a national god coincides with the rise in importance of Susa in the Elamite Empire.

Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Although he was human, the pharaoh was also believed to be descended from the gods.

According to Zurvanism, if the malevolent spirit, Angra Mainyu, and the benevolent spirit, Ahura Mazda, were twins, then they must have had a parent who existed before them. The priesthood settled on Zurvan as being the only possible absolute from whom the twins could proceed.</Text>

			<Text>Zurvan was portrayed as a transcendental and neutral god, without passion, and one for whom there was no distinction between good or evil. His worship was bound up with speculations about astrology and the world-year. However, although in its fatalism and pessimism Zurvanism was basically opposed to Mazdaism, in cult and in most doctrine it made few breaks with orthodoxy. Following the fall of the Sassanid Empire, Zoroastrianism was gradually supplanted by Islam. It seems likely that Zurvanism held significant sway during the waning years of the empire due to the degree of influence Zurvanism (but not Mazdaism) left on Shia thought.</Text>

Hinduism reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century, and, by the fourth century, several Hindu kingdoms were already established. Hindu beliefs merged with native practice to form the foundation of most surviving Kepercayaan traditions today. Java's adoption of Islam in AD 1500 would further change Kepercayaan; notably, the later introduction of Sufi concepts such as "batin" (inward self). As Indonesia does not recognize any indigenous tradition as one of its six official religions, modern folk practice has been forced to conform to larger religious norms to avoid persecution. In particular, many traditions have now adopted interpretations of monotheism.</Text>

This is to protect the deceased against bad spirits and ensure their soul reaches the highest heaven.</Text>

			<Text>One of the most prevalent features of Canaanite religion are the limestone cippi and stelae monuments found throughout the Western Phoenician world. Today, they are often described as the Phoenician "Stone Cult". Many stelae were set up over urns containing sacrificial ashes and often would be engraved with a symbol of a deity, such as Tanit. Donkeys, sheep, and goats were highly prized as sacrificial animals. Although human sacrifice was practiced, Canaanite tradition also promoted strong familial veneration for both the living and the dead. Bodies were buried with grave goods and offerings of food and drink were made to the dead to ask for guidance and ensure they would not trouble the living. This veneration also extended to the king, with an innate religious desire for political legitimacy and the imposition of divine order.</Text>

Thanks to archeological finds in areas such as Ugarit, Canaanite religious texts present a contemporary to ancient Jewish religious practice. There is strong evidence through linguistic cognates and parallel mythic cycles that both religions separated from the same Proto-Semitic source and perhaps even of the worship of Canaanite gods by the pre-Biblical Jewish people.</Text>

Light existed only as the omniscient Chiminigagua within an impenetrable shell of clay. On the occasion of the first dawn, the god broke the shell and illuminated all that had previously been chaos.

			<Text>Manichaeism was a major gnostic religion originating in Sassanid era Babylonia, founded by the prophet Mani (ca. AD 216 - 276). It taught an elaborate cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light and an evil, material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process which takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light.

Manichaean churches and scripture existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire (where it was briefly the main rival to Christianity in replacing classical paganism). Manichaeism survived longer in the East than in the West and flourished in Central Asia where it became the state religion of the Uyghur Empire in AD 762. In China, the movement was strongly opposed by Confucianism, and its followers were subject to a number of bloody repressions.

Worship is devoted to a multiplicity of gods and immortals who can be deities of phenomena, human behavior, or progenitors of lineages.
